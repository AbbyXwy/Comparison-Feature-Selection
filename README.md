# Comparison-Feature-Selection
This is the implementation for the following paper:  "Comparison of feature selection methods based on discrimination and reliability for fMRI decoding analysis"  Note: 1. Here are the codes for distinguishing different conditions (14 labels) and distinguishing different tasks (6 labels) . 2. emotion_hcp file used to remove null values. 3. The data used in this code is volume data extracted by each participant, labeled in the order of the original data set (from hcp task data set), starting from 0, these labels are stored in num_contrast_1112.mat file. Sub1. mat is a sample data.  4. Reading subject data in MATLAB requires cifti_matlab package, which requires that it must be run above the version of MATLAB 2017.  5. Softmax package has been uploaded, this package comes from the website: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Exercise:Softmax_Regression.
